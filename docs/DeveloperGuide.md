## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `contact delete Alex Yeoh`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("contact delete Alex Yeoh")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `contact delete Alex Yeoh` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Autocomplete Feature

This autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by `AutocompleteCommandBox`. It extends `CommandBox` with an autocomplete mode, which is a state stored internally as `isAutocompleteMode`. This feature also adds 
a new private class `Suggestions` to facilitate suggestion generation.
This new `AutocompleteCommandBox` class exposes one public function:

* `setupAutocompletionListeners(String commandPrefix, Suppler<List<Strings>> data)` — Attaches a new autocomplete listener which triggers autocomplete mode with `commandPrefix` and generates suggestions from `data` supplier.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/AutocompleteCommandBoxClassDiagram.png)

The following acitivity diagram gives a high level overview of the Autocomplete mechanism:

![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png)

From this diagram we see that there is 2 states of the mechanism:

* `isAutocompleteMode` — Triggered by commandPrefix
* `hasSetPrefix` — Set using `Tab` / `Shift-Tab`

Prefix in the context of the autocomplete class refers to the string we use to filter out suggestions. For example, the prefix
'ja' would give me 'jay', 'jason' as possible suggestions.

#### Sample scenario : Generating name suggestions

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step.

##### Initialization

Initialisation Code Snippet : 
```
 AutocompleteCommandBox commandBox = new AutocompleteCommandBox(cmdExecutor);
 commandBox.setupAutocompletionListeners("cname/", () -> logic.getFilteredPersonList().stream()
         .map(p -> p.getName().fullName).collect(Collectors.toList()));

```
The above code snippet will first initialise the new `AutocompleteCommandBox` object and attach an autocompletion listener, the following sequence diagram describes the processes.
See here that the commandPrefix is set to `cname/` and we are generating suggestions from the person list.


![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteInitializationSequenceDiagram.png)

Refer to the Side Note in this section on why `disableFocusTraversal()` is required.

##### Triggering Autocomplete Mode

After the autocomplete listener has been attached, users can trigger Autocomplete mode by typing in command prefix. In this case its `cname/`, and upon typing this prefix
the command box text will turn yellow signalling that the user is in autocomplete mode. In this mode, anything the user types after the command prefix till the point the user presses `TAB` will be
considered the `prefix` that will be used to generate suggestions. After `TAB` is used to set the prefix, pressing `TAB` or `Shift-TAB` will allow users to cycle through the suggestions.
Below is the sequence diagram for this flow.

![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteFlowSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Exiting Autocomplete Mode

There are two ways to exit autocomplete mode : by pressing `Enter` or `Backspace`. Below's sequence diagram illustrates the difference between the two.

![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteExitFlowSequenceDiagram0.png)
![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteExitFlowSequenceDiagram1.png)

From the diagram, we see that pressing `backspace` only unsets the prefix but does not take the user out of the autocomplete mode, allowing user to adjust their prefix to generate more accurate suggestions.
On the other hand, pressing `Enter` allows the user to lock in their suggestion, taking user out of the autocomplete mode and removing the command prefix.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Autocomplete Trigger

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check substring from caret position
  * Pros: Able to support names with spaces.
  * Cons:
      * Slightly more difficult to implement, as there are more edge cases.
      * Unable to support editing of suggestions.

* **Alternative 2:** Using regex to match pattern (e.g. `.*<CMD_PREFIX>\S*`)
  * Pros: 
      * Less complex code. (Lesser Conditionals)
      * Able to support moving caret around to adjust suggestion
  * Cons: Unable to support names with spaces as space is the delimiter.

#### Side Note

Because we iterate through autocompletion suggestions using `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` which conflicts with the inbuilt
focus traversals commands. We have to disable it using the `AutocompleteCommandBox#DisableFocusTraversal()` operation.

### Clearing all Contacts

The mechanism to clear all contacts is facilitated by `ClearCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following methods:

* `ClearCommand#execute` - Resets the AddressBook to a new empty AddressBook.

This operation is exposed in the `LogicManager` class as `LogicManager#execute`.

#### Resetting the AddressBook

Execution Code Snippet :

`model.setAddressBook(new AddressBook());`

The above code snippet sets the AddressBook in the `model` to a new `AddressBook` object. Thus, resetting the AddressBook.

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `contact clear` command.

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

### Listing all Contacts

The mechanism to list all contacts is facilitated by `ListCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following methods:

* `ListCommand#execute` - Displays all Persons in the AddressBook.

This operation is exposed in the `LogicManager` class as `LogicManager#execute`.

#### Displaying all Persons in Modduke

Execution Code Snippet :

`model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);`

The above code snippet updates the `FilteredList` of Persons in the `model` using the `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`. This fills the `FilteredList` with all Persons in the AddressBook and displays it.

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `contact list` command.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting Contacts

The mechanism to delete contacts is facilitated by `DeleteCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following methods:

* `DeleteCommand#execute` - Deletes Persons in the AddressBook according to the user input.

This operation is exposed in the `LogicManager` class as `LogicManager#execute`.

#### Parsing the User Input

The parsing of user input for `DeleteCommand` is facilitated by `DeleteCommandParser`. It extends `Parser` and implements the following methods:

* `DeleteCommandParser#parse` - Parses the user input and returns the appropriate DeleteCommand

##### Checking for Argument Prefixes

Code Snippet :

```
if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_TAG, PREFIX_MODULE)) {
    // implementation
} else if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_TAG)) {
    // implementation
} else if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_MODULE)) {
    // implementation
} else if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_MODULE, PREFIX_TAG)) {
    // implementation
} else if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME)) {
    // implementation
} else if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_TAG)) {
    // implementation
} else if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_MODULE)) {
    // implementation
} else {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, DeleteCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}

```
The above code snippet will check the prefixes present in the argument. It starts by checking if all valid prefixes are present,
then a combination of 2 prefixes, then lone prefixes and throws a `ParseException` if there are no prefixes present.

##### Choosing a Predicate

In order to find the Persons in the AddressBook who match the given arguments, `DeleteCommandParser` will pass the appropriate Predicate into
`DeleteCommand`. These are Predicates available and the code snippets of their `test` methods:
* `FullNameMatchesKeywordPredicate` - Finds Persons whose full names match the given arguments following the `n/` prefix
```
return keywords.stream()
        .anyMatch(keyword -> person.getName().fullName.toLowerCase().equals(keyword.toLowerCase()));
```
* `PersonHasTagsPredicate` - Finds Persons who have the tags that match the given arguments following the `t/` prefix
```
return tags.stream()
        .anyMatch(tag -> person.getTags().contains(tag));
```
* `PersonHasTagsAndNamePredicate` - Finds Persons whose full names match the given arguments following the `n/` prefix or have the tags that match the given arguments following the `t/` prefix
```
return names.stream()
        .anyMatch(keyword -> person.getName().fullName.toLowerCase().equals(keyword.toLowerCase()))
        ||
        tags.stream()
        .anyMatch(tag -> person.getTags().contains(tag));
```

#### Checking if Person is in a Module

In order to find Persons who are in the given Modules, a List of `ModuleNames` is passed into the `DeleteCommand` by the `DeleteCommandParser`.
Then the `DeleteCommand#execute` method calls `model#GetUpdatedFilteredPersonList` with its `predicate` and the List to retrieve Persons in the give Modules.

Retrieving Modules Code Snippet :

```
List<Module> moduleList = new ArrayList<>();
for (ModuleName name : modules) {
    Module m = moduleBook.getModule(name)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new CommandException(
                    String.format("Module %s does not exist.", name.toString())));
    moduleList.add(m);
}
```
The above code snippet is from `ModelManager#GetUpdatedFilteredPersonList` and will look through the `moduleBook` for the given Module. If the Module exists, it adds it to the List module.

Combining Predicates Code Snippet :

```
Predicate<Person> combined = x -> predicate.test(x)
        || moduleList.stream()
        .anyMatch(m -> m.getClassmates().contains(x));
return new FilteredList(filteredPersons, combined);
```
The above code snippet is from `ModelManager#GetUpdatedFilteredPersonList` and it creates a new `Predicate` that checks if a Person passes
the predicate passed into the method or is in any of the Modules in the List module. Then it uses this `Predicate` to obtain a `FilteredList`
of Persons that satisfy the `Predicate`.

##### No given Modules

If there are no given Modules, then the `DeleteCommand#execute` method calls `model#GetUpdatedFilteredPersonList` with its `predicate` only.

Obtaining FilteredList Code Snippet :
```
return new FilteredList(filteredPersons, predicate);
```

The above code snippet is from `ModelManager#GetUpdatedFilteredPersonList` and it will simply use the given `predicate` to
obtain a `FilteredList` of Persons that satisfy the `Predicate`.

#### Deleting the Filtered Persons

Once the `DeleteCommand` has retrieved the `FilteredList` of Persons, it will delete all Persons in that `FilteredList` from Modduke.

Deleting Persons Code Snippet :
```
people.stream().forEach(p -> {
    model.deletePerson(p); // delete in AddressBook
    model.updatePersonInMeetingBook(p); // delete in MeetingBook
    model.updatePersonInModuleBook(p); // delete in ModuleBook
});
```
The above code snippet will iterate through all Persons in the `FilteredList` and delete them from the `AddressBook`, `MeetingBook` and `ModuleBook`.

#### Activity Diagram

Given below is the activity diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `contact delete` command.

![DeleteActivityDiagram](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

### Copying Email Address/Phone Number of Contacts

The mechanism to copy information from contacts is facilitated by `CopyCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following methods:

* `CopyCommand#execute` - Copy email addresses or phone numbers of Persons in the AddressBook according to the user input.

This operation is exposed in the `LogicManager` class as `LogicManager#execute`.

#### Parsing the User Input

The parsing of user input for `CopyCommand` is facilitated by `CopyCommandParser`. It extends `Parser` and implements the following methods:

* `CopyCommandParser#parse` - Parses the user input and returns the appropriate CopyCommand

The mechanism used to parse user input is very similar to that of `DeleteCommandParser`, except that `CopyCommandParser`
also identifies the preamble in the arguments.

##### Identifying the Preamble

Identifying Preamble Code Snippet :

```
boolean isEmail;
String preamble = argMultimap.getPreamble().trim().toLowerCase();
if (preamble.equals("email")) {
    isEmail = true;
} else if (preamble.equals("phone")) {
    isEmail = false;
} else {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, CopyCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
```
The above code snippet will check the preamble in the argument. It assigns the boolean `isEmail` to `true` if the user
wants to copy email addresses, `false` if the user wants to copy phone numbers and throws a `ParseException` otherwise.

#### Retrieving the Filtered Persons

The mechanism used by `CopyCommand` to obtain the `FilteredList` of Persons is identical to that of `DeleteCommand`.

#### Copying Information from the Filtered Persons

Once the `CopyCommand` has retrieved the `FilteredList` of Persons, it will copy information from all Persons in that `FilteredList` from Modduke.

Obtaining Information from Persons Code Snippet :
```
if (isEmail) {
    // gets email addresses from Persons in people
    results = people.stream()
            .map(p -> p.getEmail().toString())
            .reduce("", (x, y) -> x + " " + y);
} else {
    // gets phone numbers from Persons in people
    results = people.stream()
            .map(p -> p.getPhone().toString())
            .reduce("", (x, y) -> x + " " + y);
}
```
The above code snippet will check if the user wants to copy email adresses or phone numbers using the `isEmail` boolean.
Then it iterates through the `FilteredList` of Persons and obtains the relavant information as Strings. Then it combines
the Strings into a single String.

Copying Information to Clipboard Code Snippet :
```
StringSelection selection = new StringSelection(results);
Clipboard clipboard = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard();
clipboard.setContents(selection, selection);
```
The above code snippet will then create a new `StringSelection` object using the single String of information and copy
the `StringSelection` into the user's system clipboard.

#### Activity Diagram

Given below is the activity diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `copy` command.

![CopyActivityDiagram](images/CopyActivityDiagram.png)

### Finding Contacts

The mechanism to find contacts is facilitated by `FindCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following methods:

* `FindCommand#execute` - Display Persons in the AddressBook according to the user input.

This operation is exposed in the `LogicManager` class as `LogicManager#execute`.

#### Parsing the User Input

The parsing of user input for `FindCommand` is facilitated by `FindCommandParser`. It extends `Parser` and implements the following methods:

* `FindCommandParser#parse` - Parses the user input and returns the appropriate FindCommand

The mechanism used to parse user input is very similar to that of `DeleteCommandParser`, except that `FindCommandParser`
does not look for the `m/` prefix when parsing the arguments. So it does not pass a List of Modules into the `FindCommand`.

#### Displaying the Filtered Persons

In order to display the Filtered Persons, the `FindCommand` calls `model#updateFilteredPersonList` with its `predicate`.

Update Filtered Person List Code Snippet :
```
filteredPersons.setPredicate(predicate);
```
The above code snippet is from `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` and it sets predicate of the `filteredPersons` of the model
to the given predicate. Doing so will display the Persons who satisfy the conditions specified in the user input.

#### Activity Diagram

Given below is the activity diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `find` command.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

### Labelling Contacts

The mechanism to label contacts is facilitated by `AddLabelCommand`, `ClearLabelCommand` and `DeleteLabelCommand`. They
extends `Command` and implement the following methods:

* `AddLabelCommand#execute` - Adds the specified labels to the specified Person in the AddressBook according to the user input.
* `ClearLabelCommand#execute` - Clears all labels of the specified Person in the AddressBook in the user input.
* `DeleteLabelCommand#execute` - Deletes the specified labels from the specified Person in the AddressBook according to the user input.
These operations are exposed in the `LogicManager` class as `LogicManager#execute`.

#### Parsing User Input

The parsing of user input for `AddLabelCommand`, `ClearLabelCommand` and `DeleteLabelCommand` is facilitated by
`AddLabelCommandParser`, `ClearLabelCommandParser` and `DeleteLabelCommandParser` respectively. They extend `Parser`
and implement the following methods:

* `AddLabelCommandParser#parse` - Parses the user input and returns the appropriate AddLabelCommand
* `ClearLabelCommandParser#parse` - Parses the user input and returns the appropriate ClearLabelCommand
* `DeleteLabelCommandParser#parse` - Parses the user input and returns the appropriate DeleteLabelCommand

All three parsers are identical except that they return their respective commands and `AddLabelCommandParser` and `DeleteLabelCommandParser`
parses for the `t/` prefix in the arguments.

##### Obtaining a Name Object

All three parsers call `ParserUtil#parseName` to obtain a `Name` object based on the given name in the user input.
`AddLabelCommandParser` and `DeleteLabelCommandParser` pass in the preamble of the argument into `ParserUtil#parseName`,
while `ClearLabelCommandParser` passes in the entire argument.

Parse Name Code Snippet :
```
String trimmedName = name.trim();
if (!Name.isValidName(trimmedName)) {
    throw new ParseException(Name.MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS);
}
return new Name(trimmedName);
```
The above code snippet if from `ParserUtil#parseName` and it will check if the given name is in a valid format. If it is
it creates and returns a new `Name` object with the given name. Otherwise, it throws a `ParseException`. This `Name` object
is passed into the respective command object that will be returned by each parser.

##### Obtaining a List of Tags

This is only applicable to `AddLabelCommandParser` and `DeleteLabelCommandParser`. Both parsers obtain a List of 
Strings that follow the `t/` prefix from the argument. Then it obtains a Set of Tags Strings.

Obtaining Set of Tag Strings Code Snippet:
```
if (tags.size() == 1 && tags.contains("")) {
    return Optional.empty();
}
Collection<String> tagSet = tags;
return Optional.of(ParserUtil.parseTags(tagSet));
```
The above code snippet checks for an empty String in the List of Strings. If it has an empty String, then it returns
an empty `Optional` object. Otherwise, it returns an `Optional` of the Set with the Strings in the given List.

Then both parsers check if the `Optional` object is empty. If it is, a `ParseException` is thrown. Otherwise, `AddLabelCommandParser`
passes the Set of Strings inside the `Optional` into a `LabelPersonDescriptor` which is passed into the `AddLabelCommand`
while `DeleteLabelCommandParser` passes the Set of Strings into the `DeleteCommand`. These commands are the commands
that will be returned by each parser respectively.

#### Modifying the Specified Person

`AddLabelCommand`, `ClearLabelCommand` and `DeleteLabelCommand` will first check if there is a Person with the `Name` object
given by their parsers using `model#hasPersonName`. If there does not exist a Person, then a `CommandException` is thrown.
Otherwise, the Person with the name is obtained from the AddressBook. This Person is then modified by each command accordingly.
* `AddLabelCommand` - Adds tags to the Person based on the `LabelPersonDescriptor` given by `AddLabelCommandParser`

Adding Tags Code Snippet :
```
Set<Tag> updatedTags = new HashSet<>(personToLabel.getTags());

if (labelPersonDescriptor.getTags().isPresent()) {
    updatedTags.addAll(labelPersonDescriptor.getTags().get());
}

return new Person(personToLabel.getName(), personToLabel.getPhone(), personToLabel.getEmail(), updatedTags);
```
* `ClearLabelCommand` - Clears all tags of the Person
```
return new Person(personToClear.getName(), personToClear.getPhone(), personToClear.getEmail(), new HashSet<>());
```
* `DeleteLabelCommand` - Deletes all tags from the Person based on the Set of Strings given by `DeleteLabelCommandParser`.
Throws a `CommandException` if the Person does not have a specifed tag.
```
if (tags.stream().allMatch(tag -> personToEdit.getTags().contains(tag))) {
    Set<Tag> updatedTags = new HashSet<>(personToEdit.getTags());
    updatedTags.removeAll(tags);
    return new Person(personToEdit.getName(), personToEdit.getPhone(), personToEdit.getEmail(), updatedTags);
} else {
    throw new CommandException(
            String.format("The person '%s' does not have all the tags provided.",
                    personToEdit.getName().toString()));
}
```

#### Updating Modduke

Once they have obtained the modified Person, they replace the original Person with the modified one in the `AddressBook`,
`MeetingBook` and `ModuleBook`.

Updating Modduke Code Snippet :

```
model.setPerson(personToLabel, labelledPerson);

model.updatePersonInMeetingBook(personToLabel, labelledPerson);

model.updatePersonInModuleBook(personToLabel, labelledPerson);
```

The above code snippet updates the Person in each of the three books.

#### Sequence Diagram

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `label add` command.

![AddLabelSequenceDiagram](images/AddLabelSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `label clear` command.

![ClearLabelSequenceDiagram](images/ClearLabelSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the mechanism behaves when called using the `label delete` command.

![DeleteLabelSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteLabelSequenceDiagram.png)

### Viewing a Specific Meeting's Agendas and Notes 

#### Implementation:

The mechanism to view a specific meeting's agendas and notes is primarily facilitated by the `ViewMeetingCommand`. It
extends `Command` and implements the `execute` operation:

• `execute(Model model)` - Executes the ViewMeetingCommand on the model, setting the selected meeting to update the
selected meeting field in the `ModelManager` before creating a `CommandResult` which triggers a UI update in
 `MainWindow`.
 
 <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Although the `ViewMeetingCommand` is the 
 main command to view the details of a selected meeting, other commands may also trigger UI updates for the selected
 meeting. For example, if the module name of the currently selected meeting is updated using the `EditModuleCommand`,
 a UI update will be triggered such that the changes will be reflected in the `MeetingDetailsPanel`.
 More details about this will be explained under design considerations. 
 </div>
 
 As an illustration of the interactions between the different architectural components, given below is the sequence
 diagram for the `meeting view m/CS2100 n/Report Discussion` command execution.
 
 ![ViewMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/ViewMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)
 
When the Logic signals that an update is required, the following update method in `MainWindow` is invoked to update the 
selected meeting user interface:

```
public void update() {
    logger.info("UI update triggered");
    if (logic.getSelectedMeeting() == null) {
        selectedMeetingPlaceholder.getChildren().remove(0);
    } else {
        MeetingDetailsPanel selectedMeeting = new MeetingDetailsPanel(logic.getSelectedMeeting(),
                logic.getFilteredMeetingList().indexOf(logic.getSelectedMeeting()) + 1);
        if (selectedMeetingPlaceholder.getChildren().size() == 1) {
            selectedMeetingPlaceholder.getChildren().set(0, selectedMeeting.getRoot());
        } else {
            selectedMeetingPlaceholder.getChildren().add(selectedMeeting.getRoot());
        }
    }
}
```

Given below is a object diagram of the initial state of the application. If the `MeetingBook` is not empty, the
`selectedMeeting` field in `ModelManager` will be set to the first meeting in the `MeetingBook`. Otherwise, it will be 
set to null. Note that on the first launch, the `MeetingBook` is guaranteed to have sample data with the first meeting
being CS2100 Report Discussion. Irrelevant details have been omitted from the diagram.

Given below is the object diagram after the `meeting view m/CS2103 n/Weekly Meeting` command is executed.

#### Design Considerations:

##### Ensuring the UI gets updated whenever information about the selected meeting changes

As mentioned earlier, the `SelectedMeeting` details can be changed whenever information pertaining to the meeting gets
 deleted or edited. These are the following commands that can affect the `SelectedMeeting` details
 (namely all edit and delete commands):
* `DeleteCommand` 
* `EditCommand`
* `DeleteMeetingCommand` 
* `EditMeetingCommand`
* `DeleteModuleCommand` 
* `EditModuleCommand`

Hence this feature is designed in such a way that whenever any of the above commands are executed, the Ui will be
updated accordingly if necessary. 
Given below is the activity diagram which illustrates the workflow of this process:

![ViewMeetingActivityDiagram](images/ViewMeetingActivityDiagram.png)

##### Alternatives considered
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Boolean flag `triggerUpdate` in `CommandResult`
  * Pros: 
      * Ease of implementation. (Simply set the flag to true for commands that need to update the Ui)
      * Ease of extension. (Can create additional boolean flags to update other parts of the Ui)
  * Cons:
      * Need to be wary of all cases (Must remember to adjust relevant commands to set `triggerUpdate` to true)
      * If there are many different Ui components that wish to get updated separately, can end up having many boolean 
      attributes in `CommandResult`

* **Alternative 2:** JavaFX ObservableList
  * Pros:
      * Built in support for robust observer design pattern. (Don't have to reinvent the wheel)
  * Cons:
      * Using a list is not very suitable since `SelectedMeeting` is a single value.
      * Only certain JavaFX views can be used with ObservableList.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The product should only be for a single user rather than multi-user.
2. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
3. Increments to the code should be made every week with a consistent delivery rate.
4. The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file, instead of using a DBMS.
5. The software should follow the Object-oriented paradigm primarily.
6. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
7. Should work without requiring an installer.
8. Should be able to function without having to rely on being heavily connected to a network.
9. The use of third-party frameworks and libraries should be avoided.
10. JAR files should not exceed 100Mb and PDF files should not exceed 15Mb/file.
11. All features should be easy to test. (i.e., do not depend heavily on remote APIs, do not have audio-related features and do not require creating user accounts before usage)
12. The system should repond within two seconds.
13. Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
